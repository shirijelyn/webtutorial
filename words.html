            It is still in my mind <br>
            How you held my hand <br>
            On the day that we first met <br>
            Which was the sweetest <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            We started our story <br>
            Very unexpectedly <br>
            I was the happiest <br>
            And, you were the best <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I love the way you look at me <br>
            I love the way you hug me <br>
            I love the way you kiss me <br>
            And, I love the way how much you care for me <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I thought we will be together <br>
            For a little longer <br>
            I want you to stay <br>
            But you want me to go away <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            You were once my love <br>
            I was once your love <br>
            All of the sudden events <br>
            Our love story ends
            <br>

           May our friendship last forever <br>
           A friendship that would be crazier <br>
           And, afraid enough to lose one another <br>
           This would make us happier <br>
           <br>
           <br>
           Of all the things that happened to me <br>
           Meeting you was insane <br>
           We met unexpectedly <br>
           I hope that "he" can give us time favorably <br>
           <br>
           <br>
           How lucky am I to meet you <br>
           The source of my happiness is you <br>
           You are unique in your own way <br>
           That is very lovely <br>
           <br>
           <br>
           To all the smile <br>
           To all the laughter you gave <br>
           I would never forget you <br>
           Thank you
